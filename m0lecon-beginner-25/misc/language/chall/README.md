# ðŸ›¸ Transmission: ORION Language

Greetings, human lifeform.  
We have left behind fragments of our sacred script: files marked with the seal **`.orion`**.  

---

## What you should know
- The script is **tiny**. Only a few symbols are allowed:  
  `><+-.,[]~@`  
  (andâ€¦ a couple of multi-character glyphs we will not reveal, heh).  

- It operates on **memory tapes** full of small containers (0â€“255).  
  The pointer drifts left `<` and right `>`.  
  The containers overflow and wrap like your old 8-bit toys.  

- Circles of power `[` â€¦ `]` control loops, as you might expect.  
  (But do not trust them too much, our logic isâ€¦ twisted).  

- Some glyphs toggle between parallel dimensions (two tapes).  
  Others write numbers directly, or flip meanings of symbols.  
  Only the worthy will notice.

## Final words
Do not ask for input: the script listens to **no one**.  
It simply dances through memory and reveals what it wants.  

If you manage to harness this language,  
the hidden message will unfold on your glowing rectangle.  

ðŸ”‘ The message always wears the mask: `ptm{...}`
